# Homework 2
## CMSE 381 - Fall 2022
## Due Wednesday, Sept 14, 2022


### Instructions
This homework covers three classes. Problems listed below are from [the textbook](https://www.statlearning.com/). 

- Weds 9/7, we covered Ch 2.2.1 - 2.2.2
    * 2.4.3 (*Note we have only done irreduceable error, not Bayes error since that has to do with classification*)
- Fri 9/9, we covered Sec 3.1 - Simple linear Regression
    * 3.7.8. (*Note that the commands listed are for R, not python, so you will have to convert the code accordingly.  Look over the jupyter notebook from class for examples.*)
- Mon 9/12, we covered Sec 3.2 - Multiple Linear Regression
    * 3.7.1
    * 3.7.3

*Note: the content from Weds, 9/14, will be included on HW3 due next week.*



### Important Reminders

- Homeworks must be typed. Some options for this include word, overleaf/latex, or by including a pdf of a jupyter notebook (not the .ipynb file please!). Some students have had more success in the jupyter case of printing from the browser window.  The "convert to pdf" option requires you to have latex installed. 
- Including figures when explaining your reasoning is highly encouraged.  This can be done as easily as taking a picture of a hand-drawn sketch and including it in your file. Please be sure to include all figures in the main file so we only have to look at one uploaded pdf or document. 
- I strongly encourage collaboration.  In the case that you work with others in the class, please include an acknowledgement section in your homework, mentioning people and resources you used in completing the assignment. While utilizing resources such as the internet and the textbook are encouraged, direct copy-paste is not.  You should always be able to explain any of your solutions to me after the fact. 
- The late homework policy is: 
    - Full credit if submitted on D2L by midnight Wednesday. 
    - 5% penalty if submitted by midnight Thursday.
    - 15% penalty if submitted by midnight Friday. 
    - No credit after Friday. 
    - At the end of the semester, the two lowest homework scores will be dropped.
