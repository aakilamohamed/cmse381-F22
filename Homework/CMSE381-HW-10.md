# Homework 10 
## CMSE 381 - Fall 2022
## Due Mon, Dec 5, 2022


### Instructions 


This homework covers three classes. 

- Monday 11/28 we covered 10.1 - Single layer neural nets
- Wednesday 11/30 we covered 10.2 - Multi layer neural nets 
- Friday 12/2 we covered 10.3 - CNNs

Problems listed below are from [the textbook](https://www.statlearning.com/) unless otherwise noted. 
- 10.10.1
    - For part (c), pick any values you would like for the coefficients, but be sure to tell me what they are. Then, plug in the vectors $(1,0,0,0)$, $(0,1,0,0)$, $(0,0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,0,1)$ and show the output. 
- 10.10.4 (a) and (b)
- Following the code in class from 11/30, build a neural network to predict labels in the `FashionMNIST` data set. 
    - You may use any architecture you would like, but be sure to include a neural net sketch showing your parameter choices. 
    - Evaluate your results on the test set.  What is your percentage correct? Show a confusion matrix for the resulting labels and discuss which labels tend to be misclassified in your model.
    - Make your best attempt to get this running. See the slack posts about google colab if you had issues with jupyterhub in class. Please be sure to get started early if this is you, and make use of office hours to help get it running.  If for some reason, all attempts at getting the code to run fail for you, please talk to Dr. Munch as soon as possible to discuss an alternative option for this question.





### <span style="color: green"> Submit homework to crowdmark, not D2L


You will upload your homework to the crowdmark website. The main changes are:
- You will be emailed a link to the assessment and will upload your solutions to that page. [Here is a link to the Crowdmark help page with information on submitting the homework.](https://crowdmark.com/help/completing-and-submitting-an-assessment/)
- Answers to each question will need to be uploaded separately.  So this will basically require taking portions of the pdf you were generating before and separating them when uploading.  
- Feedback on the homework will be posted via the Crowdmark website 
- Your overall grades will still be visible on D2L when they are posted. 

### Important Reminders

- Homeworks must be typed. Some options for this include word, overleaf/latex, or by including a pdf of a jupyter notebook (not the .ipynb file please!). Some students have had more success in the jupyter case of printing from the browser window.  The "convert to pdf" option requires you to have latex installed. 
- Including figures when explaining your reasoning is highly encouraged.  This can be done as easily as taking a picture of a hand-drawn sketch and including it in your file. Please be sure to include all figures in the main file so we only have to look at one uploaded pdf or document. 
- I strongly encourage collaboration.  In the case that you work with others in the class, please include an acknowledgement section in your homework, mentioning people and resources you used in completing the assignment. While utilizing resources such as the internet and the textbook are encouraged, direct copy-paste is not.  You should always be able to explain any of your solutions to me after the fact. 
- The late homework policy is: 
    - Full credit if submitted on D2L by midnight Monday. 
    - 5% penalty if submitted by midnight Tuesday.
    - 15% penalty if submitted by midnight Wednesday. 
    - No credit after Sunday. 
    - At the end of the semester, the two lowest homework scores will be dropped.
